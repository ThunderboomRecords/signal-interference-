# Markov chain using nodeJS

Small application using NodeJS to train, and use Markov chains

## Setup

Make sure you have nodejs v24.1.0 installed and are using this within this repository
Recommended is to use Mise en Place: https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html
However fnm: https://github.com/Schniz/fnm
or the slower nvm: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm will also work

After making sure Node v24 is installed. Run the following command:

```shell
npm i
```

Wait for it to complete. The setup is now complete

## Running the application

To run the application enter the following command in the terminal:

```shell
npm run dev
```
